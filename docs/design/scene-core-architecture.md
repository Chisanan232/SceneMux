# Scene Core architecture

**Status:** canonical for Phase 1 (`v0.1.0`). Written under HORO-1101, before any Scene code exists.
**Companion:** [`scene-core-ux.md`](scene-core-ux.md) — the native UX specification for everything
described here. Neither document is complete without the other: this one owns *meaning*, that one owns
*presentation*. Where they disagree about a term, this document wins; where they disagree about a
surface, that one wins.

## Why this document exists

Phase 1 is implemented by nine tickets after this one. Every one of them touches the same five words —
Scene, Semantic Home, Mount, Slot, ownership — and each word has an obvious wrong reading that would
quietly turn SceneMux back into the window manager it is derived from:

| Word | The wrong reading | What that would cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scene | "a renamed workspace" | The product becomes a skin over WinMux and the North Star is gone |
| Semantic Home | "the workspace a window is in" | Borrowing a window would silently redefine what it is *for* |
| Mount | "moved into this Scene" | Ending a Scene would strand or destroy someone's chat window |
| Slot | "a rectangle at x/y" | Layout stops being intent and starts being pixels, per monitor, forever |
| Ownership | "SceneMux manages it" | SceneMux would close windows it does not own |

So the meanings are fixed here, once, with the invariants that make them checkable, and the
implementation tickets refer back to this file rather than re-deciding.

**North Star:** *Stop managing windows. Start managing work.* / *Every task has a scene. Every window
has a place.* Native apps stay native — see [Non-goals](#non-goals) for what that rules out.

## How to read this with the rest of the repository

- [`../../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) sets document precedence; a Jira ticket outranks this file, this
  file outranks an implementer's judgement about what "Scene" ought to mean.
- [`../development/baseline-verification.md`](../development/baseline-verification.md) records how the
  inherited engine actually behaves, measured. This document only relies on behaviour recorded there or
  cited to a source file.
- [`../development/ui-verification.md`](../development/ui-verification.md) sets how the UX in the
  companion document is verified — natively, never with browser automation.
- [`../legal/ORIGIN.md`](../legal/ORIGIN.md) records what is inherited. The layering rules below exist
  partly so that inherited code stays mergeable from upstream.
